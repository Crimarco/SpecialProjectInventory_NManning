Fantastic! Now that we have a method to retrieve products with low stock levels, the next step is to integrate this method into the overall alert system for your application. Here’s how you can proceed:

### 1. Alert Generation

You’ll need to have some sort of service or background worker that regularly checks the stock levels against the thresholds. This could be a timed job that runs at certain intervals.

#### Example of a Timed Background Service:
You could implement a simple timed service in your application that periodically invokes the `GetAllProductsWithLowStockThreshold` method. Here's a conceptual example:

```csharp
public class StockAlertService
{
    private readonly Timer _timer;
    private readonly AlertManager _alertManager;

    public StockAlertService(AlertManager alertManager)
    {
        _alertManager = alertManager;
        _timer = new Timer(CheckStockLevels, null, TimeSpan.Zero, TimeSpan.FromHours(1)); // Check every hour, for example.
    }

    private void CheckStockLevels(object state)
    {
        var lowStockProducts = _alertManager.GetAllProductsWithLowStockThreshold();
        foreach (var product in lowStockProducts)
        {
            // Logic to send alerts
            // This could be creating a record in an alerts table, sending an email, etc.
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Alert Notification

For each product that has a low stock, you will need to notify the relevant users. This notification could be in the form of an email, an entry in an alert table in the database, a dashboard notification, etc.

### 3. Alert Handling on Frontend

The frontend of your application should have some way of displaying these alerts to the user. This could be a list or a popup that shows when the user logs in or when they navigate to the main dashboard.

#### Example of Alert Display Logic:
In the main form of your application, you could have a method that checks for new alerts every time the form is loaded or at regular intervals:

```csharp
public void DisplayAlerts()
{
    var lowStockProducts = _alertManager.GetAllProductsWithLowStockThreshold();
    if (lowStockProducts.Any())
    {
        // Display the alerts in the UI
        // For example, you could add items to a ListView, or show a message box, etc.
    }
}
```

### Next Steps

1. **Background Service:** Implement a background service that calls `GetAllProductsWithLowStockThreshold` periodically.
2. **Notification System:** Decide how you will notify users (e.g., email, in-app notification) and implement this.
3. **Frontend Integration:** Update your UI to display these alerts.

Let me know which part you would like to tackle next or if you need assistance with a specific aspect of the implementation.
